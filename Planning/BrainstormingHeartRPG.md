# Brainstorming HeartRPG

## Ideas
- mystery-solving rpg
- story driven with 4 fun playable characters
- puzzles for the
mystery need to have many pieces that need to be found and put together
- each character has a different tool set to help gather tools
    - one who is stealthy and can move relatively unnoticed
    - one with special senses who can hear and smell what the others can’t
    - one with the most magical abilities who can manipulate the world to find new clues and connection
    - one who is charasmatic and can get close to people to gain information and new clues
- magical mysteries in a fantasy world
- different events can be triggered by location, characters, and the clues that have been found
- a lot of distractors and red herrings
- side quest mysteries to get to know the town and increase their reputation
- once you choose your suspect and they are arrested, if it is correct you’ll get a real reward, if not someone else dies (or something other unfortunate)
- prologue to introduce each character and their abilities in 4 mini stories
- 3d or 2d
    - 2d pixel is the easiest
    - 3d is good practice and will establish a pipeline for the future
    - 3d a lot more difficult and time consuming
    - 2d has many constraints that could limit what can be made
- need a magic system with very concrete and unbreakable rules
- openish world but confined the city where the mystery takes place (maybe in a different place in the prologue)
- maybe a base where everyone hangs out - maybe the inn where they meet?
- bubbly and bright fantasy setting with dark undertones
- Project Dead City storyline without the fighting - only the mystery and character interactions
- 3d pbr with toon shading for the environment
- simple solid color 3d toon shading for anything moving
- old school cartoon animation style but 3d
- definite places needed for the first story
    - orphanage
    - inn
