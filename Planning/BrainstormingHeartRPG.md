# Brainstorming HeartRPG

## Ideas
- mystery-solving rpg
- story driven with 4 fun playable characters
- puzzles for the
mystery need to have many pieces that need to be found and put together
- each character has a different tool set to help gather tools
    - one who is stealthy and can move relatively unnoticed
    - one with special senses who can hear and smell what the others can’t
    - one with the most magical abilities who can manipulate the world to find new clues and connection
    - one who is charasmatic and can get close to people to gain information and new clues
- magical mysteries in a fantasy world
- different events can be triggered by location, characters, and the clues that have been found
- a lot of distractors and red herrings
- side quest mysteries to get to know the town and increase their reputation
- once you choose your suspect and they are arrested, if it is correct you’ll get a real reward, if not someone else dies (or something other unfortunate)
- prologue to introduce each character and their abilities in 4 mini stories
-
