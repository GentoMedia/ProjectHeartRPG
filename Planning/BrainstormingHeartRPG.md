# Brainstorming HeartRPG


## Ideas
- mystery-solving rpg
- story driven with 4 fun playable characters
- puzzles for the
mystery need to have many pieces that need to be found and put together
- each character has a different tool set to help gather tools
    - one who is stealthy and can move relatively unnoticed
    - one with special senses who can hear and smell what the others canâ€™t
    - one with the most magical abilities who can manipulate the world to find new clues and connection
    - last one?
- magical mysteries in a fantasy world
